# CMYK_Prusa
I apologize for the delay in completing the research paper, which I expect to finish by the 28th of this month. This is one of the most significant projects Iâ€™ve undertaken, and it may contain some errors. I've just reached my one-year mark in programming, and programming is half of my major. I will continue to update this until the paper is released, but I may not support afterward as I will be focusing on another major project.
